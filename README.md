# dotfiles

what I use: 
- [nix](https://nixos.org/), the package manager, not the OS. I use it mainly because devshells are cool and it works better than brew -- I'm not really interested in reproducibility, and I install a lot of tools (e.g. bun, sst) through other methods.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/). my config is based off of [nvchad 2.0](https://nvchad.com/)
- [cryptenv](https://github.com/rgodha24/cryptenv) an env manager that I made :). the main goal is to seperate aws/cloudflare accounts between different projects I'm working on.
