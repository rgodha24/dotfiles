# dotfiles

what I use: 
- [nix](https://nixos.org/), the package manager, not the OS.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/). my config is based off of [nvchad 2.0](https://nvchad.com/)
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). really nice terminal emulator
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/). fish has much better autocomplete than zsh
- [starship](https://starship.rs/). cool prompt that works with zsh and looks great
- [cryptenv](https://github.com/rgodha24/cryptenv) an env manager that I made :). the main goal is to seperate aws/cloudflare accounts between different projects I'm working on.
